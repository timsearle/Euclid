#### Supports Swift 5.0

Euclid is a cross-platform (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS) utility class written in Swift that provides convenience methods allowing the  user to perform Great-Circle mathematics with ease.

## Features
___

* Calculates the distance between two given coordinates
* Calculates the initial bearing when given source and destination coordinates
* Includes `toRadians()` and `toDegrees()` helper methods as extensions on `CLLocationDegrees`
* When given a start coordinate, bearing and distance to travel a destination coordinate is calculated
* Supports bearings in the range -180 to 180 degrees and bearings in a compass range of 0 to 360 degrees
* 100% unit test coverage

##### System requirements

+ Deployment target of iOS 9.0+ / macOS 10.11+ / tvOS 10.1+ / watchOS 3.1+
+ Xcode 10.0+
+ Swift 5.0+

## Usage
___

###  Euclid

The key Great-Circle method provided by the library is `destination` and this is accessible as a static func on the `Euclid` class.

``` Swift
public static func destination(start: CLLocationCoordinate2D, distance: CLLocationDistance, bearing: Bearing) -> CLLocationCoordinate2D { } // Destination coordinate given start, distance and bearing
let calculatedDestination = Euclid.destination(start: source, distance: 100000, bearing: bearing)
```

### Extensions on `CLLocationCoordinate2D`

``` Swift
public func distance(from coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D) -> CLLocationDistance { }
source.distance(from: destination) // Distance in metres

public func bearing(to coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D) -> CLLocationDirection { }
source.bearing(to: destination) // Bearing in range -180 - 180

public func bearing(to coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D) -> Bearing { }
source.compassBearing(to: destination) // Bearing in range 0 - 360
```

### Useful constants and types

``` Swift
Euclid.kEarthRadiusMetres // Radius of the earth in metres used by all calculations (6371e3)

public typealias Bearing = Double // Representing a bearing in the range -180 - 180
```

In addition to `Euclid` there is an additional type of `BoundingBox` that can be used to represent rectangular areas on a sphere.

``` Swift
public struct BoundingBox : CustomStringConvertible, CustomDebugStringConvertible {
    public let lowerLeft: CLLocationCoordinate2D
    public let upperRight: CLLocationCoordinate2D
    public let diagonal: CLLocationDistance
    public let midpoint: CLLocationCoordinate2D
}
```

## Installation
___

### Carthage

To integrate Euclid into your Xcode project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), specify it in your Cartfile:

`github "timsearle/Euclid"`

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built Euclid.framework into your Xcode project and update your run scripts as appropriate. For additional support, please visit the Carthage [documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos).
